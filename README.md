# DAIC-WOZ Dataset Project

## Overview
This project involves working with the DAIC-WOZ (Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz) dataset, which is widely used for research in psychological distress analysis using linguistic and acoustic features. The dataset provides valuable insights for developing predictive models that can assess mental health status.

## Dataset
The DAIC-WOZ dataset is a collection of clinical interview data used to study depression and its linguistic and acoustic correlates. The dataset includes audio recordings, transcriptions, and video files, along with associated physiological and psychological metrics.

### Accessing the Dataset
To access the DAIC-WOZ dataset, you must apply for access through the official [DAIC-WOZ website](http://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/). Approval is required to ensure the ethical use of the data, as it contains sensitive and personal information. Once approved, you will be provided with instructions on how to download the data.

### Data Preprocessing
Before using the dataset for any analysis or model training, it is crucial to perform data preprocessing to ensure the data is clean and uniform. The preprocessing steps might include:

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Apply for access to the dataset via the DAIC-WOZ official website.
2. Once access is granted, download the dataset to your local machine.
3. Follow the preprocessing steps outlined above to prepare the data for analysis.
